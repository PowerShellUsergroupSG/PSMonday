Are you really sure that your code does what it's supposed to? This session will give you a quick introduction to Pester, PowerShell's testing framework. It tells you why testing is important, why you should do it, and how it can make your life easier. This session uses real-life examples and can be your start to better and more reliable PowerShell code."

Maintenance scripts, troubleshooting scripts, post-installation scripts - with a dozen instances, these may be easy to manage manually. But when your number of instances increases, you still want that consistency and when you need to deploy an upgrade to the scripts, you want to test it prior to releasing to production. In this session, I will show how I tackle this for hundreds or thousands of instances using my DBA database and PowerShell."

                  "Nano Server is the next evolution of Windows Server. Where Server Code was still rather large and tough to manage, is this certainly not the case with Nano Server.
                   Compared to a traditional installation of Windows Server there is a different way of managing the thing, but that mainly involves Windows PowerShell and Desired State Configuration.
                   So you should be good, right?
                   Well, let’s just do a session and see if that’s the case. During this time I’ll show you several demo’s to show the difference between it and a full blown Windows Server installation (you know, a server with a (u/lo)ser interface…eeuuhh… whatcha call it? Ow yeah, a GUI).
                   I’l show you the difference both in architecture and usability, both on premise and in Azure."
