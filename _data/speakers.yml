    bio:
      "Back in 2007 I’ve started working in IT. Between then and now I’ve worked at a variety of companies such as a system integrator, retail company (fashion), consultancy firm and software vendor.
      Then, in 2011 I’ve made the big step and started my own company, Methos IT, where I specialize in Microsoft System Center, Microsoft Hyper-V, Microsoft Windows clustering, Citrix XenApp, Citrix Provisioning Server, Citrix XenDesktop and Citrix XenServer.
      Since I’m not the first person with this focus area, I wanted to make myself as unique as possible in this field, so I added my two passions to this: High Availability and PowerShell.
      And just to be clear: I’m crazy about PowerShell… the ease of which you can accomplish tasks with it and the power (especially the power…) you can gain on your environment by utilizing the shell is something I love and find truly amazing.

      <br>
      He relishes sharing and learning and can be found doing both via Twitter and his blog. He spends most of his time looking at a screen and loves to solve problems. He knows that looking at a screen so much is bad for him because his wife tells him so. Thus, you can find him on the cricket field in the summer and flying a drone in the winter.

      He has a fabulous beard."
