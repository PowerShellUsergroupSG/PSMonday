        <h2>Venue</h2>
        <p>The conference takes place in the <a href="http://www.hcc.de/" target="_blank">Hannover Conference Centrum (HCC)</a>.</p>
        <p>If you like walking, it's close enough to the main train station (MÃ¼nchen Hbf) to walk. If you don't like walking, or the weather is bad, take subway line U?? to the Haltestelle Station.</p>
        <p>If you're crazy and drove, here's where you can park: Parkhaus </p>
