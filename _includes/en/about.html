        <p>Welcome to the next great European PowerShell event!</p>

        Admins and DevOps! Conference languages are English and German. There is one continuous German track and up to three continuous English tracks.
        With more than 40 international speakers including PowerShell inventor Jeffrey Snover, and more than 60 sessions, this event is one of the most
        comprehensive leading edge conferences for anyone dealing with PowerShell. All organizers and speakers volunteer.

        <h4>Further Background</h4>
        <p>2016 is Leibniz Year in Hannover. Leibniz researched more than 300 years ago, and some of his concepts like the Monadology are spiritual
        roots of PowerShell. It is easy to get to Hannover by railway or plane, and we secured hotel contingents that you can optionally take advantage
        of when you register.</p>
